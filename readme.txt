Author: Sheldon Khongjee

==========================================
Overview
==========================================

This project performs end-to-end weather data analysis for the state of Karnataka using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 
It includes data ingestion from a CSV file, storage into MongoDB, 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning 
modeling, clustering, and time series forecasting.

==========================================
Technologies and Libraries Used
==========================================

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels (SARIMA)
- MongoDB
- Pymongo
- Tabulate

==========================================
Key Functionalities
==========================================

1. Data Ingestion
   - Load weather data from CSV
   - Insert into MongoDB collection

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values using interpolation
   - Convert time column to datetime
   - Feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, seasonal indicators)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Outlier detection
   - Time series plots (yearly, monthly trends)
   - Boxplots and histograms
   - Heatmaps of monthly averages

4. Feature Engineering
   - Temperature range, cyclical features
   - Seasonal deviations
   - Extreme weather indicators
   - Lag and rolling features
   - Interaction terms

5. Modeling
   - Random Forest Regressor to predict average temperature
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor with enhanced features
   - Cross-validation for performance stability
   - Feature importance visualization

6. Clustering
   - K-Means clustering of weather patterns
   - 2D and 3D cluster visualizations

7. Time Series Forecasting
   - SARIMA model for temperature trend forecasting
   - Diagnostic plots and accuracy evaluation

8. Model Evaluation
   - MAE, RMSE, R2 metrics
   - Actual vs. Predicted plots
   - Residual analysis
   - Model comparison

Folder Structure
==========================================

- weather.csv            --> Input dataset
- weather_analysis.ipynb --> Jupyter notebook or Python script
- README.txt             --> This file
- Images/                --> Visualizations (optional)

==========================================
How to Run
==========================================

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Ensure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017

3. Run the script or Jupyter notebook:
   python weather_analysis.py
   OR
   jupyter notebook weather_analysis.ipynb

4. Outputs include plots, model evaluations, and cluster visualizations
